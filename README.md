# PixelPencil Writer
Home to the best writing software ever to be build. Ok, maybe that is a bit over the top. But nonetheless I think it's a pretty neat desktop app I've build. 

PixelPencil helps you organize your writing. First and foremost it's a tool to write your novel in. There are lots of different text writers in the field, like Bibisco and Scrivener, so why a new desktop app?

I believe software needs to be pretty and easy to use. The former is really hard to find, certainly in the Linux Landscape. The latter is even harder to achieve. Some apps like Scrivener are so full of features you'll need a manual to use the program. Or, if you know it all, every single option is distracting you from what matters most: writing without distraction.

Here comes PixelPencil Writer in view. It's easy to learn and use, while looking pretty at the same time. But this doesn't mean that it's less feature rich! 

PixelPencil helps you organize your thoughts, dreams and ideas. You can craft your characters, locations and ideas based on what you think is neccessary to know. You are in control. That is the core of PixelPencil Writer.
